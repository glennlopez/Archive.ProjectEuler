=================
This is where I store all my solutions for <b>projecteuler.net</b>. I use project euler to test my problemsolving skills on new languages i've learned. In short, its my benchmarking/proving ground for new languages I've "aquired".
ProjectEuler is my excuse for doing recreational-math which allows me
to work on my problemsolving skills while understanding math in a fun and engaging way.
