=================
This is where I store all my solutions for <b>projecteuler.net</b>. I use project euler as my benchmarking/proving ground for new languages I've "aquired". I try to use as little library/includes as possible while trying to keep my solution eligant and beutiful. 
ProjectEuler is also my excuse for doing recreational-math which allows me
to work on my problemsolving skills while understanding/forcing-me-to-learn about math in a fun and engaging way.
