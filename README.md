=================
This is where I store all my solutions for <b>projecteuler.net</b>.
ProjectEuler is my excuse for doing recreational-math, allowing me
to work on my problem solving skills and understand which areas of computer science I still need to work on. The problems create an inductive chain learning experience. Solving one problem exposes me to new math/programming concepts that enables me to undertake more difficult problems.
